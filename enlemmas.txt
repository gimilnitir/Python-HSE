Professor Openshaw always lost his temper with a loud bang if anybody called him a Spiritualist or a believer in Spiritualism This however did not exhaust his explosive element for he also lost his temper if anybody called him a disbeliever in Spiritualism It wa his pride to have given his whole life to investigating Psychic Phenomena it wa also his pride never to have given a hint of whether he thought they were really psychic or merely phenomenal He enjoyed nothing so much a to sit in a circle of devout Spiritualists and give devastating description of how he had exposed medium after medium and detected fraud after fraud for indeed he wa a man of much detective talent and insight when once he had fixed his eye on an object and he always fixed his eye on a medium a a highly suspicious object There wa a story of his having spotted the same Spiritualist mountebank under three different disguise dressed a a woman a white bearded old man and a Brahmin of a rich chocolate brown These recital made the true believer rather restless a indeed they were intended to do but they could hardly complain for no Spiritualist denies the existence of fraudulent medium only the Professor s flowing narrative might well seem to indicate that all medium were fraudulent But woe to the simple minded and innocent Materialist and Materialists a a race are rather innocent and simple minded who presuming on this narrative tendency should advance the thesis that ghost were against the law of nature or that such thing were only old superstition or that it wa all tosh or alternatively bunk Him would the Professor suddenly reversing all his scientific battery sweep from the field with a cannonade of unquestionable case and unexplained phenomenon of which the wretched rationalist had never heard in his life giving all the date and detail stating all the attempted and abandoned natural explanation stating everything indeed except whether he John Oliver Openshaw did or did not believe in Spirits and that neither Spiritualist nor Materialist could ever boast of finding out Professor Openshaw a lean figure with pale leonine hair and hypnotic blue eye stood exchanging a few word with Father Brown who wa a friend of his on the step outside the hotel where both had been breakfasting that morning and sleeping the night before The Professor had come back rather late from one of this grand experiment in general exasperation and wa still tingling with the fight that he always waged alone and against both side Oh I don t mind you he said laughing You don t believe in it even if it s true But all these people are perpetually asking me what I m trying to prove They don t seem to understand that I m a man of science A man of science isn t trying to prove anything He s trying to find out what will prove itself But he hasn t found out yet said Father Brown Well I have some little notion of my own that are not quite so negative a most people think answered the Professor after an instant of frowning silence anyhow I ve begun to fancy that if there is something to be found they re looking for it along the wrong line It s all too theatrical it s showing off all their shiny ectoplasm and trumpet and voice and the rest all on the model of old melodrama and mouldy historical novel about the Family Ghost If they d go to history instead of historical novel I m beginning to think they d really find something But not Apparitions After all said Father Brown Apparitions are only Appearances I suppose you d say the Family Ghost is only keeping up appearance The Professor s gaze which had commonly a fine abstracted character suddenly fixed and focused itself a it did on a dubious medium It had rather the air of a man screwing a strong magnifying glass into his eye Not that he thought the priest wa in the least like a dubious medium but he wa startled into attention by his friend s thought following so closely on his own Appearances he muttered crikey but it s odd you should say that just now The more I learn the more I fancy they lose by merely looking for appearance Now if they d look a little into Disappearances Yes said Father Brown after all the real fairy legend weren t so very much about the appearance of famous fairy calling up Titania or exhibiting Oberon by moonlight But there were no end of legend about people disappearing because they were stolen by the fairy Are you on the track of Kilmeny or Thomas the Rhymer I m on the track of ordinary modern people you ve read of in the newspaper answered Openshaw You may well stare but that s my game just now and I ve been on it for a long time Frankly I think a lot of psychic appearance could be explained away It s the disappearance I can t explain unless they re psychic These people in the newspaper who vanish and are never found if you knew the detail a I do and now only this morning I got confirmation an extraordinary letter from an old missionary quite a respectable old boy He s coming to see me at my office this morning Perhaps you d lunch with me or something and I d tell the result in confidence Thanks I will unless said Father Brown modestly the fairy have stolen me by then With that they parted and Openshaw walked round the corner to a small office he rented in the neighbourhood chiefly for the publication of a small periodical of psychical and psychological note of the driest and most agnostic sort He had only one clerk who sat at a desk in the outer office totting up figure and fact for the purpose of the printed report and the Professor paused to ask if Mr Pringle had called The clerk answered mechanically in the negative and went on mechanically adding up figure and the Professor turned towards the inner room that wa his study Oh by the way Berridge he added without turning round if Mr Pringle come send him straight in to me You needn t interrupt your work I rather want those note finished tonight if possible You might leave them on my desk tomorrow if I am late And he went into his private office still brooding on the problem which the name of Pringle had raised or rather perhaps had ratified and confirmed in his mind Even the most perfectly balanced of agnostic is partially human and it is possible that the missionary s letter seemed to have greater weight a promising to support his private and still tentative hypothesis He sat down in his large and comfortable chair opposite the engraving of Montaigne and read once more the short letter from the Rev Luke Pringle making the appointment for that morning No man knew better than Professor Openshaw the mark of the letter of the crank the crowded detail the spidery handwriting the unnecessary length and repetition There were none of these thing in this case but a brief and businesslike typewritten statement that the writer had encountered some curious case of Disappearance which seemed to fall within the province of the Professor a a student of psychic problem The Professor wa favourably impressed nor had he any unfavourable impression in spite of a slight movement of surprise when he looked up and saw that the Rev Luke Pringle wa already in the room Your clerk told me to come straight in said Mr Pringle apologetically but with a broad and rather agreeable grin The grin wa partly masked by mass of reddish grey beard and whisker a perfect jungle of a beard such a is sometimes grown by white men living in the jungle but the eye above the snub nose had nothing about them in the least wild or outlandish Openshaw had instantly turned on them that concentrated spotlight or burning glass of sceptical scrutiny which he turned on many men to see if they were mountebank or maniac and in this case he had a rather unusual sense of reassurance The wild beard might have belonged to a crank but the eye completely contradicted the beard they were full of that quite frank and friendly laughter which is never found in the face of those who are serious fraud or serious lunatic He would have expected a man with those eye to be a Philistine a jolly sceptic a man who shouted out shallow but hearty contempt of ghost and spirit but anyhow no professional humbug could afford to look a frivolous a that The man wa buttoned up to the throat in a shabby old cape and only his broad limp hat suggested the cleric but missionary from wild place do not always bother to dress like cleric You probably think all this another hoax Professor said Mr Pringle with a sort of abstract enjoyment and I hope you will forgive my laughing at your very natural air of disapproval All the same I ve got to tell my story to somebody who know because it s true And all joking apart it s tragic a well a true Well to cut it short I wa missionary in Nya Nya a station in West Africa in the thick of the forest where almost the only other white man wa the officer in command of the district Captain Wales and he and I grew rather thick Not that he liked mission he wa if I may say so thick in many way one of those square headed square shouldered men of action who hardly need to think let alone believe That s what make it all the queerer One day he came back to his tent in the forest after a short leave and said he had gone through a jolly rum experience and didn t know what to do about it He wa holding a rusty old book in a leather binding and he put it down on a table beside his revolver and an old Arab sword he kept probably a a curiosity He said this book had belonged to a man on the boat he had just come off and the man swore that nobody must open the book or look inside it or else they would be carried off by the devil or disappear or something Wales said this wa all nonsense of course and they had a quarrel and the upshot seems to have been that this man taunted with cowardice or superstition actually did look into the book and instantly dropped it walked to the side of the boat One moment said the Professor who had made one or two note Before you tell me anything else Did this man tell Wales where he had got the book or who it originally belonged to Yes replied Pringle now entirely grave It seems he said he wa bringing it back to Dr Hankey the Oriental traveller now in England to whom it originally belonged and who had warned him of it strange property Well Hankey is an able man and a rather crabbed and sneering sort of man which make it queerer still But the point of Wales s story is much simpler It is that the man who had looked into the book walked straight over the side of the ship and wa never seen again Do you believe it yourself asked Openshaw after a pause Well I do replied Pringle I believe it for two reason First that Wales wa an entirely unimaginative man and he added one touch that only an imaginative man could have added He said that the man walked straight over the side on a still and calm day but there wa no splash The Professor looked at his note for some second in silence and then said And your other reason for believing it My other reason answered the Rev Luke Pringle is what I saw myself There wa another silence until he continued in the same matter of fact way Whatever he had he had nothing of the eagerness with which the crank or even the believer tried to convince others I told you that Wales put down the book on the table beside the sword There wa only one entrance to the tent and it happened that I wa standing in it looking out into the forest with my back to my companion He wa standing by the table grumbling and growling about the whole business saying it wa tomfoolery in the twentieth century to be frightened of opening a book asking why the devil he shouldn t open it himself Then some instinct stirred in me and I said he had better not do that it had better be returned to Dr Hankey What harm could it do he said restlessly What harm did it do I answered obstinately What happened to your friend on the boat He didn t answer indeed I didn t know what he could answer but I pressed my logical advantage in mere vanity If it come to that I said what is your version of what really happened on the boat Still he didn t answer and I looked round and saw that he wasn t there The tent wa empty The book wa lying on the table open but on it face a if he had turned it downwards But the sword wa lying on the ground near the other side of the tent and the canvas of the tent showed a great slash a if somebody had hacked his way out with the sword The gash in the tent gaped at me but showed only the dark glimmer of the forest outside And when I went across and looked through the rent I could not be certain whether the tangle of the tall plant and the undergrowth had been bent or broken at least not farther than a few foot I have never seen or heard of Captain Wales from that day I wrapped the book up in brown paper taking good care not to look at it and I brought it back to England intending at first to return it to Dr Hankey Then I saw some note in your paper suggesting a hypothesis about such thing and I decided to stop on the way and put the matter before you a you have a name for being balanced and having an open mind Professor Openshaw laid down his pen and looked steadily at the man on the other side of the table concentrating in that single stare all his long experience of many entirely different type of humbug and even some eccentric and extraordinary type of honest men In the ordinary way he would have begun with the healthy hypothesis that the story wa a pack of lie On the whole he did incline to assume that it wa a pack of lie And yet he could not fit the man into his story if it were only that he could not see that sort of liar telling that sort of lie The man wa not trying to look honest on the surface a most quack and impostor do somehow it seemed all the other way a if the man wa honest in spite of something else that wa merely on the surface He thought of a good man with one innocent delusion but again the symptom were not the same there wa even a sort of virile indifference a if the man did not care much about his delusion if it wa a delusion Mr Pringle he said sharply like a barrister making a witness jump where is this book of yours now The grin reappeared on the bearded face which had grown grave during the recital I left it outside said Mr Pringle I mean in the outer office It wa a risk perhaps but the le risk of the two What do you mean demanded the Professor Why didn t you bring it straight in here Because answered the missionary I knew that a soon a you saw it you d open it before you had heard the story I thought it possible you might think twice about opening it after you d heard the story Then after a silence he added There wa nobody out there but your clerk and he looked a stolid steady going specimen immersed in business calculation Openshaw laughed unaffectedly Oh Babbage he cried your magic tome are safe enough with him I assure you His name s Berridge but I often call him Babbage because he s so exactly like a Calculating Machine No human being if you can call him a human being would be le likely to open other people s brown paper parcel Well we may a well go and bring it in now though I assure you I will consider seriously the course to be taken with it Indeed I tell you frankly and he stared at the man again that I m not quite sure whether we ought to open it here and now or send it to this Dr Hankey The two had passed together out of the inner into the outer office and even a they did so Mr Pringle gave a cry and ran forward towards the clerk s desk For the clerk s desk wa there but not the clerk On the clerk s desk lay a faded old leather book torn out of it brown paper wrapping and lying closed but a if it had just been opened The clerk s desk stood against the wide window that looked out into the street and the window wa shattered with a huge ragged hole in the glass a if a human body had been shot through it into the world without There wa no other trace of Mr Berridge Both the two men left in the office stood a still a statue and then it wa the Professor who slowly came to life He looked even more judicial than he had ever looked in his life a he slowly turned and held out his hand to the missionary Mr Pringle he said I beg your pardon I beg your pardon only for thought that I have had and half thought at that But nobody could call himself a scientific man and not face a fact like this I suppose said Pringle doubtfully that we ought to make some inquiry Can you ring up his house and find out if he ha gone home I don t know that he s on the telephone answered Openshaw rather absently he life somewhere up Hampstead way I think But I suppose somebody will inquire here if his friend or family miss him Could we furnish a description asked the other if the police want it The police said the Professor starting from his reverie A description Well he looked awfully like everybody else I m afraid except for goggles One of those clean shaven chap But the police look here what are we to do about this mad business I know what I ought to do said the Rev Mr Pringle firmly I am going to take this book straight to the only original Dr Hankey and ask him what the devil it s all about He life not very far from here and I ll come straight back and tell you what he say Oh very well said the Professor at last a he sat down rather wearily perhaps relieved for the moment to be rid of the responsibility But long after the brisk and ringing footstep of the little missionary had died away down the street the Professor sat in the same posture staring into vacancy like a man in a trance He wa still in the same seat and almost in the same attitude when the same brisk footstep were heard on the pavement without and the missionary entered this time a a glance assured him with empty hand Dr Hankey said Pringle gravely want to keep the book for an hour and consider the point Then he asks u both to call and he will give u his decision He specially desired Professor that you should accompany me on the second visit Openshaw continued to stare in silence then he said suddenly Who the devil is Dr Hankey You sound rather a if you meant he wa the devil said Pringle smiling and I fancy some people have thought so He had quite a reputation in your own line but he gained it mostly in India studying local magic and so on so perhaps he s not so well known here He is a yellow skinny little devil with a lame leg and a doubtful temper but he seems to have set up in an ordinary respectable practice in these part and I don t know anything definitely wrong about him unless it s wrong to be the only person who can possibly know anything about all this crazy affair Professor Openshaw rose heavily and went to the telephone he rang up Father Brown changing the luncheon engagement to a dinner that he might hold himself free for the expedition to the house of the Anglo Indian doctor after that he sat down again lit a cigar and sank once more into his own unfathomable thought Father Brown went round to the restaurant appointed for dinner and kicked his heel for some time in a vestibule full of mirror and palm in pot he had been informed of Openshaw s afternoon engagement and a the evening closed in dark and stormy round the glass and the green plant guessed that it had produced something unexpected and unduly prolonged He even wondered for a moment whether the Professor would turn up at all but when the Professor eventually did it wa clear that his own more general guess had been justified For it wa a very wild eyed and even wild haired Professor who eventually drove back with Mr Pringle from the expedition to the North of London where suburb are still fringed with heathy waste and scrap of common looking more sombre under the rather thunderstorm sunset Nevertheless they had apparently found the house standing a little apart though within hail of other house they had verified the brass plate duly engraved J I Hankey MD MRCS Only they did not find J I Hankey MD MRCS They found only what a nightmare whisper had already subconsciously prepared them to find a commonplace parlour with the accursed volume lying on the table a if it had just been read and beyond a back door burst open and a faint trail of footstep that ran a little way up so steep a garden path that it seemed that no lame man could have run up so lightly But it wa a lame man who had run for in those few step there wa the misshapen unequal mark of some sort of surgical boot then two mark of that boot alone a if the creature had hopped and then nothing There wa nothing further to be learnt from Dr J I Hankey except that he had made his decision He had read the oracle and received the doom When the two came into the entrance under the palm Pringle put the book down suddenly on a small table a if it burned his finger The priest glanced at it curiously there wa only some rude lettering on the front with a couplet They that looked into this book Them the Flying Terror took and underneath a he afterwards discovered similar warning in Greek Latin and French The other two had turned away with a natural impulsion towards drink after their exhaustion and bewilderment and Openshaw had called to the waiter who brought cocktail on a tray You will dine with u I hope said the Professor to the missionary but Mr Pringle amiably shook his head If you ll forgive me he said I m going off to wrestle with this book and this business by myself somewhere I suppose I couldn t use your office for an hour or so I suppose I m afraid it s locked said Openshaw in some surprise You forget there s a hole in the window The Rev Luke Pringle gave the very broadest of all broad grin and vanished into the darkness without A rather odd fellow that after all said the Professor frowning He wa rather surprised to find Father Brown talking to the waiter who had brought the cocktail apparently about the waiter s most private affair for there wa some mention of a baby who wa now out of danger He commented on the fact with some surprise wondering how the priest came to know the man but the former only said Oh I dine here every two or three month and I ve talked to him now and then The Professor who himself dined there about five time a week wa conscious that he had never thought of talking to the man but his thought were interrupted by a strident ringing and a summons to the telephone The voice on the telephone said it wa Pringle it wa rather a muffled voice but it might well be muffled in all those bush of beard and whisker Its message wa enough to establish identity Professor said the voice I can t stand it any longer I m going to look for myself I m speaking from your office and the book is in front of me If anything happens to me this is to say good bye No it s no good trying to stop me You wouldn t be in time anyhow I m opening the book now I Openshaw thought he heard something like a sort of thrilling or shivering yet almost soundless crash then he shouted the name of Pringle again and again but he heard no more He hung up the receiver and restored to a superb academic calm rather like the calm of despair went back and quietly took his seat at the dinner table Then a coolly a if he were describing the failure of some small silly trick at a seance he told the priest every detail of this monstrous mystery Five men have now vanished in this impossible way he said Every one is extraordinary and yet the one case I simply can t get over is my clerk Berridge It s just because he wa the quietest creature that he s the queerest case Yes replied Father Brown it wa a queer thing for Berridge to do anyway He wa awfully conscientious He wa also so jolly careful to keep all the office business separate from any fun of his own Why hardly anybody knew he wa quite a humorist at home and Berridge cried the Professor What on earth are you talking about Did you know him Oh no said Father Brown carelessly only a you say I know the waiter I ve often had to wait in your office till you turned up and of course I passed the time of day with poor Berridge He wa rather a card I remember he once said he would like to collect valueless thing a collector did the silly thing they thought valuable You know the old story about the woman who collected valueless thing I m not sure I know what you re talking about said Openshaw But even if my clerk wa eccentric and I never knew a man I should have thought le so it wouldn t explain what happened to him and it certainly wouldn t explain the others What others asked the priest The Professor stared at him and spoke distinctly a if to a child My dear Father Brown Five Men have disappeared My dear Professor Openshaw no men have disappeared Father Brown gazed back at his host with equal steadiness and spoke with equal distinctness Nevertheless the Professor required the word repeated and they were repeated a distinctly I say that no men have disappeared After a moment s silence he added I suppose the hardest thing is to convince anybody that 0 0 0 0 Men believe the oddest thing if they are in a series that is why Macbeth believed the three word of the three witch though the first wa something he knew himself and the last something he could only bring about himself But in your case the middle term is the weakest of all What do you mean You saw nobody vanish You did not see the man vanish from the boat You did not see the man vanish from the tent All that rest on the word of Mr Pringle which I will not discus just now But you ll admit this you would never have taken his word yourself unless you had seen it confirmed by your clerk s disappearance just a Macbeth would never have believed he would be king if he had not been confirmed in believing he would be Cawdor That may be true said the Professor nodding slowly But when it wa confirmed I knew it wa the truth You say I saw nothing myself But I did I saw my own clerk disappear Berridge did disappear Berridge did not disappear said Father Brown On the contrary What the devil do you mean by on the contrary I mean said Father Brown that he never disappeared He appeared Openshaw stared across at his friend but the eye had already altered in his head a they did when they concentrated on a new presentation of a problem The priest went on He appeared in your study disguised in a bushy red beard and buttoned up in a clumsy cape and announced himself a the Rev Luke Pringle And you had never noticed your own clerk enough to know him again when he wa in so rough and ready a disguise But surely began the Professor Could you describe him for the police asked Father Brown Not you You probably knew he wa clean shaven and wore tinted glass and merely taking off those glass wa a better disguise than putting on anything else You had never seen his eye any more than his soul jolly laughing eye He had planted his absurd book and all the property then he calmly smashed the window put on the beard and cape and walked into your study knowing that you had never looked at him in your life But why should he play me such an insane trick demanded Openshaw Why because you had never looked at him in your life said Father Brown and his hand slightly curled and clinched a if he might have struck the table if he had been given to gesture You called him the Calculating Machine because that wa all you ever used him for You never found out even what a stranger strolling into your office could find out in five minute chat that he wa a character that he wa full of antic that he had all sort of view on you and your theory and your reputation for spotting people Can t you understand his itching to prove that you couldn t spot your own clerk He ha nonsense notion of all sort About collecting useless thing for instance Don t you know the story of the woman who bought the two most useless thing an old doctor s brass plate and a wooden leg With those your ingenious clerk created the character of the remarkable Dr Hankey a easily a the visionary Captain Wales Planting them in his own house Do you mean that place we visited beyond Hampstead wa Berridge s own house asked Openshaw Did you know his house or even his address retorted the priest Look here don t think I m speaking disrespectfully of you or your work You are a great servant of truth and you know I could never be disrespectful to that You ve seen through a lot of liar when you put your mind to it But don t only look at liar Do just occasionally look at honest men like the waiter Where is Berridge now asked the Professor after a long silence I haven t the least doubt said Father Brown that he is back in your office In fact he came back into your office at the exact moment when the Rev Luke Pringle read the awful volume and faded into the void There wa another long silence and then Professor Openshaw laughed with the laugh of a great man who is great enough to look small Then he said abruptly I suppose I do deserve it for not noticing the nearest helper I have But you must admit the accumulation of incident wa rather formidable Did you never feel just a momentary awe of the awful volume Oh that said Father Brown I opened it a soon a I saw it lying there It s all blank page You see I am not superstitious
